# :cyclone: APOLOGEE - Siemens Field Panel Scanner (Metasploit Module):

APOLOGEE is a Python script and Metasploit module that enumerates a hidden directory on Siemens APOGEE PXC BACnet Automation Controllers (all versions prior to V3.5) and TALON TC BACnet Automation Controllers (all versions prior to V3.5). With a 7.5 CVSS, this exploit allows for an attacker to perform an authentication bypass using an alternate path or channel to access hidden directories in the web server.  This repository takes advantage of CVE-2017-9947.

# CVE:

An attacker with network access to the integrated web server (Ports 80/TCP and 443/TCP) could bypass the authentication and download sensitive information from the device.

A directory traversal vulnerability could allow a remote attacker with network access to the integrated web server (Ports 80/TCP and 443/TCP) to obtain information on the structure of the file system of the affected devices.

## Details:

- **CVSS v3:** 7.5
- **Vendor:** Siemens
- **Equipment:** BACnet Field Panels
- **Vulnerabilities:** Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel, Path Traversal
- **Products:** APOGEE PXC BACnet Automation Controllers: All versions prior to V3.5 and TALON TC BACnet Automation Controllers: All versions prior to V3.5

## Mitigation:

Siemens has provided firmware Version V3.5 for BACnet Field Panels Advanced modules, which fixes the vulnerabilities, and they recommend that users update to the new fixed version. Users should contact the local service organization for further information on how to obtain and apply V3.5. The web form is available at the following location on the Siemens web site:

# Scripts:

Two Python scripts are available: siemens_field_panel_scanner.py and APOLOGEE.py. The siemens_field_panel_scanner.py script is a Metasploit module that can be loaded into the framework for simple auxiliary uses on internal Operational Technology and Industrial Control System (ICS) networks. The APOLOGEE.py script is a standalone program for enumerating field panels using standard command line arguments.
